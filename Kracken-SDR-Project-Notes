## GNU Radio Block for KrakenSDR

This is a GNU Radio Block for KrakenSDR. It connects via a TCP socket connection to the KrakenSDR DAQ server software called Heimdall. 
Heimdall handles all sample and phase coherence calibration via the noise source, 
and this block receives the coherent IQ sample output and makes it available for further DSP processing in GNU Radio.
