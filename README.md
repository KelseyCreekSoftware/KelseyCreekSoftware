- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KelseyCreekSoftware
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in GNURadio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about IQ file formats
- Just started working on SigMF and other [RF baseband IQ samples file formats](IQ-File-Information.md)
- Here are some [blue file project notes](Blue-File-1-1-Project-Notes.md)
